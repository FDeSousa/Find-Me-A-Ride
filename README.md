Find Me A Ride
==============
Simple Android app to find the user's current location and lookup information on cab firms in the area.

Current State
-------------
-	Displays current location on a MapView
-	Allows changing of location with custom location
-	Doesn't lookup cab firms currently as it has not yet been implemented.

Future Plans
------------
-	Add lookup functionality (lookup a remote SQL Db)
-	Add ability to phone company directly from listing
-	Layout new Activity View for cab firm lookup
